1. Git clone the activity-06 repository down into my w205 directory
2. Started docker container using:
	docker run -it --rm -v c:\Users\AOlson\w205:/w205 midsw205/base:latest bash
I'm using a windows machine so this allowed me to use the curl command to get the file
3. Move the docker-compose.yml file from kafka folder to the activity-06 folder (did this in GUI)
4. Ran "docker-compose up -d" to ensure the docker compose would start up appropriately
5. Tested docker-compose using "docker-compose ps" which returned the following output:

             Name                          Command            State                    Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
activity06ajolson89_kafka_1       /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up      29092/tcp, 9092/tcp
activity06ajolson89_mids_1        /bin/bash                   Up      8888/tcp
activity06ajolson89_zookeeper_1   /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up      2181/tcp, 2888/tcp, 32181/tcp, 3888/tcp

  - Analyzing the yml file, we can see that these ports align with the ports specified in the docker-compose file
6. Ran the command: docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --create --topic foo --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --if-not-exists --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
	- Saw that topic 'foo' was created
7. Checked the topic using: docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --describe --topic foo --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
  - Recieved the following valid response: 
  Topic:foo       PartitionCount:1        ReplicationFactor:1     Configs:
        Topic: foo      Partition: 0    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1
        
8. Ran the following docker-compose exec command per homework instructions to use file assessment-attempts-20180128-121051-nested.json and kafkacat to push real messages to kafka
	docker-compose exec mids bash -c "cat /w205/assessment-attempts-20180128-121051-nested.json | jq '.[]' -c | kafkacat -P -b kafka:29092 -t foo && echo 'Produced 100 messages.'"
  - Received message that the command couldn't find the json file - need to use appropriate windows notation
9. I realized through several attempts that the json file I pulled down was expired. Ran docker-compose down to get out and entered back into
the midsw205/base image to run a new curl command
	curl -L -o assessment-attempts-20180128-121051-nested.json https://goo.gl/f5bRm4
This pulled the correct file. Went back through the various commands listed here (starting from step 4) and didn't get an error message

10. Checked that messages were in fact listed under the topic foo by running the following command which printed the first 5 messages. 
	docker-compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --topic foo --from-beginning --max-messages 5
11. Ran 'docker-compose down' to stop running the containers and exit safely.
